## Background

In the early 1980’s, the world was experiencing a rapid evolution in personal computers and digital technology. At Roland DG, we realized that the computer was essentially a large brain, and that by attaching peripherals to serve as human hands, we could help people rediscover the original joy of creation and close the gap between the virtual and real worlds. This insight contributed to the very origin of our business.

While producing prototypes for a pen plotter, our flagship product at the time, an engineer came up with the idea of developing 3D milling machines by replacing the pen with an end mill, and then adding height (Z axis) to the X and Y axes.

Thanks to a corporate culture that encourages innovation, in 1986 we unveiled the world’s first desktop 3D milling machine, the CAMM-3 PNC-3000. By enabling greater production control, it drastically cut product design and development time, leading designers to dub it the “Magic Hand.”

In high schools and university labs, our 3D digital tools are now used to train a new generation of engineers and product designers. In recent years, we have extended our technology into the dental world where the utmost precision is required to make dental prosthetics.

Since ancient times, people have used their hands to transform dreams into reality through a process of adding and subtracting. Today’s designers and engineers, raised in a society of digital devices, are poised to transform the world by giving form to entirely new concepts and ideas.

In 2014, we launched our first Additive Manufacturing Machine and a new Subtractive Manufacturing Machine - two devices designed to bring your ideas to life. We call them “monoFab.”

With both additive and subtractive 3D tools to choose from in desktop configurations, people are now able to make the most of their creativity like never before.

It is a machine to perform small fabrics with resolution of 1 micron.
The build plate is 1x3/32 mm 
The milling tool can perform 2 port cutting, 4 port cutting and could be flat nose or balled nose.
