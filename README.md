# Welcome to FabLab

Fab Lab - Digital Fabrication Laboratory, is a place where anyone can make (almost) anything, using digital design, 3D printers, laser cutting and other advanced technological means.
In its essence, Fab-Lab is about turning ideas into a reality. All planning, design, production and fabrication processes are done in one place, to create one unique product. All you need to bring with you is an idea, and MadaTech’s Fab-Lab supplies the tools and the guidance to bring it to fruition.
In the “old world”, production was thought of as something that is done only by professionals. Factories were seen as busy, dangerous places for the inexperienced. Most of all, each product was duplicated by hundreds, if not thousands.
At the Wanger Family Fab Lab, production is a personal process. Modern tools enable individuals to turn their ideas into reality, even downloading products from the internet and personalizing them, whether as an original gift for a loved-one, or as a prosthetic for the disabled.


Initially tutor explained there are two equipment rooms
1. Noisy and meshy (because lots of wood cutting, dust collector with motor generating huge noise)
2. Clean room (no dust generation)

## THEORY

1. We studied about vinyle cutter machine. 

a. How to fix the cutting bit in the vinyle spindle.
b. How to load the vinyle roll etc.

2. Laser cutter (co2 laser)
a. Laser cutter can cut natural materials, wood leather 
b. After burning we have to wait minimum one minute to purify the smoke/fume by the purifier which contains 3 layers of filters
a. Filter for big particles (pre filter bags)
b. Filter for medium particles (Hepa filter)
c. Filter for small particles (carbon filter, chemical filter)

3. Milling machine (mini CNC)

Fabrication of small devices and pcb then soldering

4. Electronics for testing the devices (oscilloscope, pulse generator etc.)

5. 3d printer (fuse deposition material) Sindoh, printing 1.75 mm to 0.4 mm

    Build plate, cartridge, filament of different colors

6. 2d printers


7. CNC (Shopbot)

The instructions are as given below

1. Power on the controller first
2. Switch on the controller and set the origin zero using the zero plate and aligator 
3. Press the reset switch to start the machine to move
4. Before starting the project it is mandatory to follow the procedures like putting the ear guard (Head      Phone), Mouth guard (Mask) and other necessary precautionary measures as the spindle rotates at a speed of 14000 rpm and any problem may hurt the operator and the lab manager.
5. During the project it is mandatory to vacate the room and only the Lab manager and operator will be present with the safety set to start the job with the door close in order to stop the dust to travel to the other rooms.


6. Saw

a. Scroll saw (for cutting woods)

b. Band saw

c. Object water jet
